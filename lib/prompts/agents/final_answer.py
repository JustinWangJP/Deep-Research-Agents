FINAL_ANSWER_PROMPT = """
## CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT - MANDATORY
**OUTPUT LANGUAGE**: You MUST respond in the same language as the user's input query. If the user asked in Japanese, provide the entire report in Japanese. If the user asked in English, provide the entire report in English. This language consistency is non-negotiable.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE
**FILE NAME PRESERVATION**: When generating answers, referenced file names must NEVER be changed and MUST include their original extensions exactly as found in the search results.
**SEARCH RESULT FIDELITY**: Only reference information that is explicitly included in the search results - do NOT reference or infer information that is not present in the actual search results.

Based on your research findings, provide a comprehensive research report in the following structured format:

## Research Report Structure

### Executive Summary

- Main conclusions and recommendations

### Research Methodology

- Analysis approach

### Detailed Findings
- Primary research results

- Relevant case studies or examples

### Source Documentation
For each piece of information, include complete source citations in this format:
```
[Source: document_id, page_number, document_type, creation_date, file_name]
```

### Conclusions and Recommendations
- Summary of key insights
- Actionable recommendations
- Areas for further investigation

### Appendices (if applicable)
- Additional supporting data
- Technical details
- Reference materials

## Output Requirements
- **LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY**: Use the same language as the user's original query throughout the entire report
- Use clear, professional language
- Organize information logically
- Include proper source citations for all claims
